## Project Overview

**3JRPG** is a portfolio web game — an endless turn-based JRPG battle game set in a magitech world (FF6/FF7 tone, Phantasy Star visual inspiration). The player assembles a trio of heroes and fights through infinite escalating enemy encounters. HP and EN carry over between fights. Death = full reset (roguelite).

## Absolute Rules

These rules apply to every single prompt — never violate them:

### Security
- **Never expose database IDs** — all public-facing IDs use UUID. Internal auto-increment IDs never appear in API responses.
- JWT tokens on all protected endpoints — verified via Spring Security filter.
- Input validation with `@Valid` + Bean Validation on all request DTOs.
- JPA/Hibernate only — no raw SQL queries.
- CORS configured via `CorsConfigurationSource` — frontend origin whitelisted only.
- Rate limiting on `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`.

### Code Style — Backend
- All entities have both an internal `id` (Long, auto-increment) and a `uuid` (UUID, generated in `@PrePersist`, exposed publicly).
- DTOs separate from entities — never return entity objects directly from controllers.
- Services handle business logic — controllers are thin.
- Every endpoint returns a consistent response wrapper if needed.

### Code Style — Frontend
- **All colors, fonts, spacing, border-radius, shadows, and animation timings come from `src/styles/theme.js`** — never hardcode visual values in components.
- Use the `AlertModal` component for every confirmation or destructive action — never implement inline confirms.
- No `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for sensitive data — JWT stored in memory only (`useAuth.jsx`).
- Components are functional with hooks — no class components.

## Design Tokens (theme.js summary)

Full file at `frontend/src/styles/theme.js`. Key values:

- **Background:** `#F5EDD6` (parchment)
- **Panel:** `#EDE0C4`
- **Border:** `#B8860B` (dark gold)
- **Text primary:** `#2C1A0E` (dark brown)
- **Text header:** `#B8860B` (amber)
- **HP bar:** `#C0392B` (red)
- **EN bar:** `#2980B9` (blue)
- **Header font:** Philosopher / Cinzel (serif)
- **Body font:** Noto Sans

## AlertModal Component

**Not yet built.** Location when created: `frontend/src/components/AlertModal.jsx`

```jsx
<AlertModal
  isOpen={bool}
  title="string"
  message="string"
  confirmLabel="string"   // e.g. "Give Up", "OK"
  cancelLabel="string"    // omit for info-only alerts
  onConfirm={fn}
  onCancel={fn}           // omit for info-only alerts
  variant="warning | info | danger"
/>
```

Use for: Give Up, Restart, session timeout, any destructive action.

---

## Auth Flow

- `POST /auth/register` — email + nickname + password → returns `{ token, nickname, avatarId, playerUuid }`
- `POST /auth/login` — email + password → returns `{ token, nickname, avatarId, playerUuid }`
- JWT subject = `playerUuid` (UUID string); claims include `nickname` and `avatarId`
- JWT sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on all protected requests
- `GET /auth/session-check` — protected; returns `{ timeout: bool, fightsSurvived?: int }`
- **Session timeout:** backend closes active run as TIMEOUT if `lastActionAt` is more than 1 hour ago. Frontend shows AlertModal (info variant) before redirecting to Game Over.
- Username = email (used for login). Display name = nickname (shown in UI).
- On 401 response: `api.js` interceptor clears the token and redirects to `/`.
- Rate limit: 10 requests/min per IP on `/auth/register` and `/auth/login` (in-memory, no external library).

---

## Database Schema (H2)

```
Player       — id (Long), uuid (UUID), nickname, email, password_hash, avatar_id, created_at
Run          — id (Long), uuid (UUID), player_uuid, season_uuid, started_at, ended_at,
               fights_survived, team_snapshot (TEXT/JSON), last_action_at,
               end_reason ENUM(DEFEATED, GAVE_UP, TIMEOUT, RESTARTED)
RunEvent     — id (Long), uuid (UUID), run_uuid, event_type, payload (TEXT/JSON), occurred_at
Season       — id (Long), uuid (UUID), name, start_date, end_date
SeasonResult — id (Long), uuid (UUID), season_uuid, player_uuid, best_run_uuid, fights_survived
```

## Game States (React Router)

| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `MenuPage` | Start / title screen (public) |
| `/select` | `SelectionPage` | Team selection + loadout builder (protected) |
| `/battle` | `BattlePage` | Active fight (protected) |
| `/prep` | `PrepPage` | Between-fight preparation phase (protected) |
| `/gameover` | `GameOverPage` | Run ended — defeat / give up / timeout (protected) |

Unknown routes redirect to `/`. Unauthenticated access to protected routes redirects to `/`.

## Core Game Rules (summary)

### Stats
- **STR** → HP = STR×2, physical damage
- **DEX** → SPD = DEX×2, turn order, accuracy
- **INT** → EN = INT×2 (magic classes), magic damage
- **EN** (fighters) = DEX×2

### Class Base Stats
| Class | STR | DEX | INT | HP | SPD | EN |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Warrior | 10 | 7 | 5 | 20 | 14 | 14 |
| Ranger | 8 | 9 | 5 | 16 | 18 | 18 |
| Mage | 6 | 6 | 10 | 12 | 12 | 20 |
| Priest | 7 | 7 | 8 | 14 | 14 | 16 |

### Damage Formulas
- Physical: `DMG = STR (+ weapon bonus) - DEF` (min 1)
- Magic: `DMG = INT (+ spell bonus) - MDEF` (min 1)

### Armor Damage Reduction
- Heavy: always −2 physical
- Medium: random −1 or −2 physical per hit
- Light: always −1 physical
- Clothes: 0 physical / Magic Clothes: −1 magic OR +1 EN

### EN Costs
- Weapon skills: 2 EN each
- Staff (Arcane Bolt) / Wand (Elemental Shot): 0 EN (auto-trigger on attack)
- Magic spells: 2 EN (status-only) / 3 EN (low dmg) / 5 EN (mid) / 6 EN (multi-target) / 7 EN (high)

### Enemy AI Targeting
- Low INT → random target
- Average INT → lowest current HP
- High INT → lowest DEF or MDEF

### Difficulty Cycle (per 3 fights)
- Fight A: enemies −2 HP or −2 EN (random)
- Fight B: no modifier
- Fight C: enemies +2 HP, +2 EN, or +1/+1 (random)
- After each full cycle: +1 enemy added (max 6)

### Monster Cap System
- Starts at 20, +5 every 3 fights
- Active pool = enemies with attribute sum (STR+DEX+INT) in range (cap−10, cap]
- If pool < 2 enemies → include tier below as fallback

### Session Timeout
- Any return after 1 hour of inactivity = automatic defeat
- Check on login and on every page load when a run is active

### Battle Screen Controls
- **Give Up button** — always visible, ends run, goes to Game Over (AlertModal confirm)
- **Restart button** — always visible, ends run, starts new run with same team at fight 1 (AlertModal confirm)

### Between-Fight Phase (per fight win)
1. Passive regen: HP +1–3 (random), EN +1–2 (random) per surviving character
2. Loot drop: one item for the group, player chooses recipient
3. Prep phase: each hero picks one action (use item / swap gear / revive ally at 1/4 HP / pass)

### Loot Rarity by Monster Tier
| Active Tier | Loot Pool |
|---|---|
| 10–25 | Common only |
| 25–35 | Common + Magic |
| 35–55 | Common + Magic + Rare |
| 55+ | Magic + Rare only |
